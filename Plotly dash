Certainly — based on the synergy opportunities between your model development team and the analytics/consuming team, a Proof of Concept (PoC) led jointly (or supported by EEC) could focus on validating how Sigma or a similar tool can improve collaboration, model evaluation, and decision support across teams while complying with governance requirements.

Here are some PoC ideas that directly build on that synergy:


---

1. Model Output Exploration & QA via Sigma

Goal: Enable the analytics team to explore model scores, drivers, and edge cases independently.

Use Sigma to surface daily/weekly model scores and associated features.

Build shared dashboards for investigating false positives/negatives.

Allow business users to apply ad hoc filters (e.g. by customer segment, geography, risk band).


Synergy: Reduces back-and-forth, builds shared context between model developers and analytics.


---

2. Collaborative Model Tuning Interface

Goal: Enable the analytics team to simulate business rules or threshold changes on top of model outputs.

Sigma dashboard includes a “threshold slider” to observe impact on precision/recall.

Overlay SAR filing outcomes or analyst feedback.

Provide model score distributions by segment.


Synergy: Makes it easier to co-define model cutoffs or thresholds based on real business constraints.

3. Data Explainability & Traceability Pilot

Goal: Validate that sensitive attributes (e.g. PII) used in development can be understood, traced, and governed properly.

Use Sigma to show what features contributed to a score.

Include join logic or lineage view (obfuscated, not raw PII).

Showcase how sensitive attributes affect decisions without exposing them.


Synergy: Supports model trust and satisfies compliance, while enhancing transparency to non-technical users.


---

4. Cross-Team Alert Review Workflow

Goal: Build a lightweight feedback loop between model and analytics teams.

Sigma surfaces alerts from model outputs.

Business team tags alerts as “true positive,” “needs escalation,” or “irrelevant.”

Feedback is stored for model refinement.


Synergy: Accelerates model iteration based on business validation, directly in a shared UI.


---

5. Business Simulation: Impact of Model on Key Metrics

Goal: Empower analytics to test “what-if” scenarios using model outputs.

Load historic data into Sigma with model scores attached.

Let analytics team simulate how a model-driven workflow would affect KPIs (e.g. number of SARs filed, analyst workload, fraud captured).


Synergy: Ensures downstream teams can engage with the model in a business-relevant way, not just technically.
