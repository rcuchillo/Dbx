Perfect ‚Äî deploying the best model to **score live transaction data** completes your Databricks + MLflow + Feature Store + Serving pipeline. Here's how to showcase this in a **structured, visual demo**:

## ‚úÖ Demo Overview: Real-Time Fraud Scoring Pipeline

| Step | Description                                                                    |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£  | Deploy best model to **Databricks Model Serving**                              |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£  | Modify data generator script to **send new transactions**                      |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£  | Use a lightweight Python or notebook client to **score new data via REST API** |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£  | (Optional) Display live fraud scores in a **dashboard/table**                  |

## üü¶ 1. Deploy the Best Model (One-Time Setup)

Assuming your best model is registered as `Fraud_Detection_LGBM_Optimized`:

### ‚úÖ Go to Model Registry:

* Locate `Fraud_Detection_LGBM_Optimized`
* Promote the best version to **"Production"**
* Click **"Enable Serving"**
  ‚Üí You‚Äôll receive a REST endpoint like:

```
https://<workspace-url>/model/Fraud_Detection_LGBM_Optimized/1/invocations
```

---

## üü¶ 2. Modify Generator to Send Transactions to Model API

Here‚Äôs how to extend your existing transaction generator script to **send new rows for scoring**:

```python
import requests
import json
import pandas as pd

# Replace with your actual serving URL and token
SERVING_URL = "https://<workspace-url>/model/Fraud_Detection_LGBM_Optimized/1/invocations"
DATABRICKS_TOKEN = "dapi-XXXXXXXXXXXX"

def score_transaction(transaction_df):
    payload = {
        "dataframe_records": transaction_df.to_dict(orient="records")
    }
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {DATABRICKS_TOKEN}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    response = requests.post(SERVING_URL, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
    return response.json() if response.status_code == 200 else response.text
```

### üß™ Use in generator thread:

After generating a new batch of data:

```python
batch_df = pd.read_csv("uk_synthetic_transactions.csv").tail(50)  # simulate latest batch
features = batch_df[["transaction_count", "avg_amount", "p95_amount", ...]]  # must match model features
scores = score_transaction(features)
print("Fraud probabilities:", scores)
```

---

## üü¶ 3. Visualize Live Scoring (Notebook Cell or Dashboard)

```python
from IPython.display import display, clear_output
import time

while True:
    new_batch = pd.read_csv("uk_synthetic_transactions.csv").tail(50)
    scores = score_transaction(new_batch[["avg_amount", "p95_amount", "fraud_ratio", ...]])
    new_batch["fraud_score"] = scores
    clear_output(wait=True)
    display(new_batch[["card_number", "amount", "merchant_name", "fraud_score"]])
    time.sleep(10)
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Talking Points for Governance

| Feature                      | What It Enables                               |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Model Registry + Serving** | Auditable, versioned deployment               |
| **REST Scoring API**         | Easy to integrate with any system             |
| **Token-based Security**     | Controlled access for production applications |
| **Logging in MLflow**        | All runs + usage linked to specific versions  |
| **Real-time feedback loop**  | Monitor fraud score effectiveness             |

---

## ‚úÖ Optional Enhancements:

* Score raw transactions using **Feature Store lookups** on the fly
* Push scored data to **Delta table or dashboard**
* Add **threshold-based alerting** or streaming triggers

Would you like:

* A **real-time dashboard (Plotly or Dash)** for displaying fraud scores?
* The full modified version of the **generator script with scoring included**?
* An Airflow/Job/DBX task to schedule the end-to-end pipeline?
