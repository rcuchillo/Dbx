Of course — “beacon” can sound a bit informal or too conceptual.
A clearer and more professional alternative is “reference points”, “anchor cases”, or “exemplar SARs” depending on the tone you want.

Here’s the revised executive email with that wording adjusted:

Subject: Proposal: Tactical ML Approach to Enhance SAR Coverage in High-Priority Typologies

Dear [Recipient/Team],

I’d like to propose a tactical enhancement to our current detection strategy aimed at improving SAR coverage in low-volume but high-impact typologies such as Human trafficking and Terrorist financing.

Currently, our models focus on very high threshold scores (e.g., ≥ 0.98), which works well for high-volume typologies but may miss relevant activity in more sensitive, intelligence-led areas. To address this, the idea is to use known high-scoring SARs as anchor cases to identify customers with similar behavioural profiles in the model’s feature space — even if their scores fall just below the operational threshold.

How it would work

Anchor on known SARs: Select high-scoring SARs from priority typologies.

Neighbourhood search: Identify unalerted customers with similar transaction and behavioural profiles.

Risk prioritisation: Rank candidates based on similarity, score, and typology metadata.

Operational triage: Produce targeted tactical lists for investigation or intelligence teams.


Expected Benefits

Broader SAR coverage in niche risk scenarios.

Improved alignment with intelligence priorities.

Increased ability to surface hidden suspicious activity.

Minimal operational uplift through targeted lists rather than mass alerting.


Pilot Proposal

I recommend a 3-month pilot:

Weeks 1–4: Build and test the similarity search prototype.

Weeks 5–10: Generate and triage tactical lists with intelligence teams.

Weeks 11–14: Evaluate impact and refine thresholds.


This tactical layer would complement our existing model framework, offering a smarter way to surface additional suspicious activity where the stakes are highest.

If this aligns with your priorities, I’d be happy to walk through the proposal in more detail and shape the pilot plan together.

Best regards,

Would you like me to make this email slightly more concise (e.g., trimming the technical explanation) for a faster executive read?
