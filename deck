Subject: Re: VISA Request for Additional Fraud Data

Hi Ian,

Thanks for the note. My view is that we should not share any additional data at this stage. I agree with Rich that we should first seek guidance from Compliance and Legal before making any commitment.

Sharing declined fraud data raises potential governance and confidentiality considerations, and unless there is a clear regulatory or contractual obligation, my position is to limit data sharing to what is strictly required.

On the point about increasing reliance on future VISA models, this should ultimately depend on the demonstrated incremental value they bring compared to our existing capabilities. VISA already has visibility of fraud we are not preventing, so any enhancement from their side can be explored without further data exposure from us.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Would you like me to make it slightly firmer or more diplomatic in tone?
