Subject: Feedback on Tech Stack & Architecture Document

Hi [Name],

Thanks for sharing the ‚ÄúTech Stack & Architecture‚Äù document. It‚Äôs a strong starting point and shows thoughtful alignment across tooling, standardisation, and orchestration strategies. I appreciate the clear structure and the logical flow from core components to initial scope and decision-making. A few suggestions to refine and strengthen the message further:


---

‚úÖ Strengths

Clear articulation of components: The descriptions of MLFlow, Airflow, Feast, and the standardisation tools are concise and informative.

Alignment with MLOps best practices: You‚Äôve correctly identified critical areas like versioning, automation, reproducibility, and tech standardisation.

Actionable initial scope: The section on GitLab migration and code quality improvements is practical and achievable.

Forward-looking orchestration strategy: Good call-out on the Celery Kubernetes worker and broader user enablement.

Benefits section is impactful: It nicely connects the tools to real value (e.g., E2E orchestration, efficiency, reproducibility).

üõ†Ô∏è Improvement Areas

1. Clarify Target vs Current State

The document would benefit from clearly marking what is currently in place vs. what is proposed.

For example, you might introduce a table or tags (e.g., ‚úÖ Existing | üöß Planned) to help stakeholders quickly assess progress and effort.



2. Make Benefits More Quantifiable (Where Possible)

The "Benefits" section is strong, but consider tying at least one or two benefits to measurable outcomes (e.g., time saved in deployment, % improvement in reproducibility, reduced cost with open source).



3. Add Timeline or Milestones

The ‚ÄúInitial Scope of Work‚Äù would benefit from rough timelines or phases (e.g., Q3: GitLab migration | Q4: Airflow expansion).

This helps in tracking progress and setting expectations with stakeholders.



4. Improve Consistency in Writing Style

Some sentences are slightly long or contain mixed clauses (e.g., the paragraph on orchestration and Celery workers). These could be broken down for readability.

Avoid passive voice where active voice makes intent clearer (e.g., ‚ÄúFeast should work with Airflow‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúWe will integrate Feast with Airflow‚Ä¶‚Äù).



5. Highlight Integration Points More Visually

Consider using a diagram (in the final version) to show how MLFlow, Airflow, Feast, GitLab, etc., integrate across the stack.

This will support exec-level and technical readers in understanding system interdependencies quickly.



6. Use Confluence & Workshop Plans More Concretely

Great that you mentioned knowledge-sharing and Confluence. Would suggest briefly stating:

Who owns the setup of Confluence as a knowledge base?

How often and who leads the workshops?

Will there be recordings/templates?

üîö Final Thoughts

This is a solid draft and well aligned to our broader platform modernisation efforts. With a few refinements around clarity, structure, and planning, it can serve as a robust working document for both engineering and leadership audiences. Let me know once updated ‚Äì happy to review again.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
