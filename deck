Understood — here’s a tighter, more natural version that reads like an executive project update rather than something “polished by AI”:

Subject: Re: Request for Sign-Off – BB TM Final Feature Set

Dear all,

All relevant stakeholders have been involved since the start of the project, and we will ensure the appropriate representative signs off before go-live.

The model has been built on sterling transactional data, which was part of the proposal from the outset. The request to use GTSA data only came towards the end of development, making it difficult to include now without materially delaying delivery. To address this, we have implemented guardrails and shown that the model still performs well on currency-related SARs using proxy indicators.

To avoid further delay and loss of benefit, my recommendation is to proceed with the current model and guardrails, while continuing to expand coverage in the next phase. This will allow us to deliver value now while strengthening the model longer term.

Kind regards,
[Your Name]

Would you like me to make it even more direct and one-page board-style (just 2 short paragraphs), so it feels like a crisp sign-off note?
