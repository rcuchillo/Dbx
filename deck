Thank you — that context is important. Here's a refined set of bullet points tailored for your use case involving Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), ring-fencing alerts below the threshold, and sampling for Back-to-Live (BTL) testing:

✅ Why Use the Model at svire > 0.17 for SAR Escalation

SAR-Quality Alert Concentration: Alerts with svire > 0.17 capture the majority of alerts historically leading to SAR filings, ensuring high-value escalations remain prioritized.

Efficient Resource Allocation: Focusing investigations above 0.17 allows investigative resources to concentrate on alerts most likely to result in SARs, improving case quality and throughput.

Operational Scalability: The alert volume above 0.17 is manageable within existing team capacity, while alerts below can be ring-fenced for deferred processing or automation.

Ring-Fencing Below Threshold: Alerts scoring ≤0.17 are not discarded but safely isolated, preserving full auditability and enabling targeted review as needed.

BTL Sampling Ensures Control: A representative sample from the ring-fenced population is worked through BTL to monitor model drift, uncover emerging patterns, and validate missed fraud risk.

SAR Filing Rates Validate Threshold: Historical analysis shows a significantly higher SAR filing rate for alerts >0.17 versus those below, supporting the threshold as a natural operational cutoff.

Risk Appetite Alignment: The proposed threshold reflects the organization’s current risk appetite and balances risk mitigation with customer experience and operational cost.

Regulatory Defensibility: The combined approach (active review >0.17 + sampling ≤0.17) demonstrates a structured, risk-based methodology aligned with regulatory expectations for suspicious activity detection.

BTL Insights Feed Continuous Improvement: Alerts sampled through BTL are analyzed for missed cases and used to fine-tune model thresholds and retraining processes.

No Blind Spots Introduced: By maintaining coverage through ring-fencing and BTL sampling, the institution retains visibility into lower-scoring alerts without overwhelming the operational team.
