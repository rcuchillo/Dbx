Here’s a concise, structured version of your notes that you can send to your team while keeping the key points clear and actionable:

---

**Subject:** Transaction Model – Key Updates

Team,

Following discussions with Vangelis and TMCS, here are the agreed points going forward:

1. **Primary Focus**

   * Target delivery quality at least as good as **SAM8**.
   * The "threat delivery" exercise is interesting but must not delay or impact the main solution delivery.

2. **Feature Review & Mapping**

   * TMCS will review our features **once we have a manageable, prioritised set** to share.
   * They will map these features to **TMRA** and **financial crime risk scenarios**.

3. **Rules Development**

   * Expect strong pushback from TMCS on rule development due to **resource constraints** (already escalated).
   * While they may say rules should be “by exception,” we should be realistic that this won’t always hold true.

4. **Scope Guidance from Vangelis**

   * If something is **not covered by SAM8** (e.g., loans, mortgages), it is *good to have* but **not mandatory**.
   * Replicating SAM8 use cases was discussed but **discarded** for obvious reasons.

Let’s keep our focus sharp on the agreed priorities and minimise distractions from side exercises.

If you want, I can also prepare a **one-line bullet “cheat sheet”** version you can paste into Teams for a faster update.
