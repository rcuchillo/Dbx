Hi [Name],

Thanks for your message, and hope you're settling back in smoothly.

On your first point — in machine learning, especially in supervised approaches like the one we're using, features can often be abstract and not directly mapped to individual Financial Crime risk scenarios. Just because a feature may conceptually relate to a particular risk does not necessarily mean the model will be able to detect or prioritise it. This largely depends on the training data — specifically, the volume and quality of SARs aligned to each risk scenario.

If the business can provide a clear lineage between SARs and their corresponding risk scenarios, we’d be happy to run some targeted analysis to assess model coverage in that context.

Regarding feature discounting, we can explore keyword searches or tagging methods to investigate specific risk characteristics. However, this would require some alignment upfront to ensure we’re using consistent terminology and risk definitions.

Lastly, it’s important to clarify that this ML model is not a detection tool. Its role is to prioritise alerts already generated by SAM8. SAM8 remains the core detection engine, and the tactical ML model is not intended to extend or enhance risk coverage directly.

Happy to chat further if useful.

Best,
[Your Name]
