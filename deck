Hereâ€™s a concise summary of whatâ€™s working well and what could be improved based on the document:

---

### âœ… **Whatâ€™s Working Well:**

* **Responsive and collaborative teams**, especially on recent BioCatch and Credit Redex workstreams.
* **Strong relationships and informal communication**, making collaboration easy.
* **Good understanding of each otherâ€™s work**, which helps with planning and change processes.
* **High technical skills and domain knowledge** on both teams.
* **Effective collaboration** between Quant and Analytics, especially when communication is regular.
* **Focus on delivery** during frequent meetings, even if it adds pressure.

### ðŸ”§ **What Could Be Improved:**

* **Need for a shared dashboard/tracker** to manage dependencies, blockers, and ownershipâ€”would boost transparency and accountability.
* **Greater clarity on responsibilities**, especially with multiple services and stakeholders involved.
* **More face time between teams**, particularly GCQA/FA meeting new joiners and aligning approaches.
* **Consistency in tools and methodologies**, especially across Debit/Credit/retail portfolios.
* **Better data and technology sharing**, e.g., using **Databricks** to centralize access and speed up development.
* **Improve data consistency** by aligning on the same sources for model monitoring and FA.
* **Establish feedback loops** post-model implementation.
* **Enhance communication** between IVU and FA by sharing queries and documentation.
* **Create a shared SharePoint space** for governance documents, including fairness analysis.
