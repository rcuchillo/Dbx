Aman – Mid-Year Feedback

What’s going well: Since joining the team, Aman has made excellent progress and quickly added value across several areas. The quality of the model governance documentation has improved significantly under his lead, and the positive feedback from stakeholders reflects that effort. He has also been proactive in drafting the code for the FML model benefits, and his technical work on the VISA score has been impressive — it's great to see stakeholders now looking to onboard the model.

The upcoming redevelopment of the credit card model presents a strong opportunity for Aman to further showcase his technical abilities and build even stronger relationships with stakeholders. His involvement in broader initiatives, such as supporting hiring in Noida and contributing to the Hackathon, has also been appreciated and reflects his commitment to the team.

Areas to build on: To continue growing and increasing his influence, Aman should focus on:

Speaking Up and Sharing Ideas: While it’s natural to be cautious in a team with experienced modelers, new joiners bring fresh perspectives that are essential for progress. Aman should feel confident in sharing his ideas and constructively challenging the status quo — this is how we evolve and improve.

Confidence and Visibility: As his technical contributions continue to grow, building confidence to contribute in discussions and take ownership of new initiatives will be key. This will also help him build a stronger presence within the team and with stakeholders.


Support moving forward: Aman has already made a strong start and shown great potential. With continued confidence in his voice and ideas, he can play a key role in shaping our models and ways of working. I’m excited to see how he takes on the credit card model redevelopment and continues to grow his impact in the second half of the year.
