Subject: Re: Ownership Transfer and Strategic Delivery

Hi Christian,

Thanks for the detailed update.

The tactical use of the PB model as youâ€™ve outlined does make sense, especially to avoid any gaps while the strategic work is still ongoing.

Do you know if the EDP team is in a position to deliver the tactical data pipeline to support this approach? That would help us assess the viability of progressing in parallel without waiting on the full strategic delivery.

Appreciate the continued coordination.

Best regards,
Remi
