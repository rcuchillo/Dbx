Certainly ‚Äî here's a slide-ready version with clear, articulate bullet points that highlight the key issues under Data Storage & Versioning:


---

üîç Current Issues in Data Storage & Versioning

Storage constraints due to multiple copies of similar datasets

No single source of truth, leading to confusion and inconsistency

Difficult to track dataset versions, impacting reproducibility and governance

Fragmented data use cases: separate datasets for monitoring, model refresh, rebuild, and validation

Version sprawl across teams and projects with limited visibility or control

Poor metadata practices, making lineage and auditing challenging

Redundant processing and effort due to lack of centralized version management

Risk of using outdated data in production or model retraining workflows
