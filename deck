Subject: Re: PB Mules Model Output for ACE Analytics

Hi [Recipient's Name],

Thank you for the note.

I wasn’t previously aware that the model score was being consumed for analytics purposes, and I’d appreciate some reassurance that this usage is strictly analytical and not feeding into any form of decisioning. If the score is being used to support strategic planning or MI reporting, I believe it’s important that someone from our team is involved to ensure we are aligned and comfortable with how the outputs are being interpreted and applied.

I understand there's an intention to leverage the model for analysis and that the delay in model availability is impacting your delivery timelines. However, this hasn’t been communicated to us previously, and it would be helpful to get clarity on the specific objectives. This will ensure that any insights generated can be looped back into model development and, more importantly, prevent any duplication of effort—as we are also actively conducting risk coverage and trend analysis to inform future model iterations.

Given the current resource constraints and the delays we've already experienced—despite Salma’s commendable efforts to keep things on track—we can only offer limited support until the model has been validated. That said, we are happy to share a sample of customer scores to support your initial testing. Salma can work with someone from your team to coordinate what’s feasible or share the data required for our validation process, which should be sufficient to get you started.

Once you’ve had a chance to review, I’d be happy to arrange a call to align on our respective workstreams. I can already see potential synergies that could benefit our financial crime models going forward.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
