Subject: Re: Description of Method

Hi Pritish,

I hope you're doing well.

As mentioned earlier this week, we are planning to deploy a solution to monitor the volume of data loaded into our database, serving as a predictive data control. The approach will combine classic forecasting techniques with anomaly detection—either threshold-based or machine learning (still to be confirmed)—but will not involve more advanced methods such as deep learning or GenAI.

Based on our understanding, this setup does not qualify as a model, as it will not be used for decision-making or external reporting.

Best regards,
Rémi
