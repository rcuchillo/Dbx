Hi AL,

I’m struggling to understand the rationale behind this request:
"Review Raw Features – Joanne and Karan to review the list of 3000+ raw features for any missed risks, as much as possible before Quants (Remi and Anthony) return."

Reviewing the full list of features will not help identify missed risks. Any feature that was dropped was excluded because it did not provide predictive value for identifying suspicious behaviour.

If the goal is to ensure the ML model supports low-risk sampling effectively, I would recommend focusing on missed SARs in the Qo sample post-guardrails instead.

Given the timeline and the reasoning, I don’t see value in conducting this review for the tactical model. However, I’m supportive of documenting this if it helps provide clarity and reassurance.

Do you want me to make it more direct and critical (challenging the request firmly) or softer and more collaborative?
