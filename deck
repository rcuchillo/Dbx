Subject: Follow-up on Approach Discussion

Hi all,

Thanks for setting up the discussion earlier. I wanted to share my perspective as I had to drop off the call.

If the deck is intended for presentation to 1LOD, I’d suggest simplifying it slightly — some slides feel quite dense and overly descriptive. The proposed metrics for effectiveness, such as recall, “SwapIns/SwapOuts” (positive examples), and conversion rate for efficiency, make sense.

From a presentation standpoint, I’d recommend focusing on the best achievable scenario — showing recall that is better or equivalent and a higher conversion rate compared with the incumbent solution at the risk scenario level. The positive SARs should include autos, manuals, and new SARs; I wouldn’t narrow the comparison to autos only unless there’s specific pushback. Ultimately, our goal is to identify more suspicious activity — and faster — at the risk scenario level.

It’s also worth anticipating that most discussions will likely center around left-to-right coverage rather than right-to-left. My view is that it would be beneficial to start that dialogue early, before diving into detailed performance assessment.

Finally, it’s important to acknowledge some tolerance — we might not achieve better recall for every scenario while also improving efficiency. Balancing these trade-offs transparently will strengthen the message.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Would you like me to make it slightly shorter and sharper (for a senior audience with limited time), or keep this balanced version with full context?
