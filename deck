Subject: Feedback on Vendor Call

Hi [Name],

I wanted to share some feedback on today’s call with the vendor.

Overall, the discussion was a step forward compared to the previous one — it was less of a sales pitch and more focused on the methodology, which was appreciated. That said, I remain somewhat sceptical about the solution being truly “unsupervised” in the strict sense. It appears closer to a semi-supervised approach, where a small set of anchor points is used via a feedback loop to identify customers with similar behaviours. This is not fundamentally different from what we already do or are exploring (e.g., with the tactical model for retail).

I also question how meaningful the probability score is in such a setup, given that alerts would still require review. Their explanation of how the blended models are combined and how outputs are calibrated wasn’t entirely clear, though this is more of a detail.

What I found lacking was evidence of performance. The only slide that touched on this was vague — it briefly mentioned SAR filings but didn’t provide any insight into the quality of those SARs or conversion rates, which would have been valuable.

Best,
[Your Name]

Would you like me to make it more formal (for senior stakeholders) or keep this neutral and conversational as it is?
