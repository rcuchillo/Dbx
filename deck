Here’s a polished draft you could use as your reply — it acknowledges Lee’s framing, positions your point clearly, and keeps the tone executive and solution-oriented:

Draft Response:

Hi Kirsteen,

Thanks, and I agree with Lee’s framing of the dependencies. For the detection element specifically, having a data product ready for consumption will be key to our ability to deliver.

Assuming the relevant funding already communicated is in place, I believe the Quants team should be able to deliver. That said, there may be some unknowns as we are still in the process of delivering the first solution, so we should plan for a degree of contingency.

Best regards,
Remi

Would you like me to make this slightly firmer (emphasising feasibility with funding), or more cautious (leaning into the risks/unknowns)?
