Subject: Re: Mules Models Ownership Transfer and PB Implementation

Hi Rich,

Thanks for the note – I completely appreciate the frustration here, and I’ve taken some time to catch up with the team to get a full view of the background, as I wasn’t across all previous conversations.

As you noted, the £50k funding was secured over a year ago, but due to the Cloudera exit, EDP weren’t in a position to prioritise the work at the time. From what I understand now, EDP are willing to support a tactical deployment, but they’ve been consistently clear that Fraud Tech would need to take long-term ownership – and that clarity on the handover plan and timeline is still pending.

Ownership has been a recurring theme for several months, and both of us have been included in conversations with Natasha and Sonali since September last year. I also understand Anthony has made repeated efforts to bridge EDP and Fraud Tech to get this moving, but discussions have largely gone in circles.

At this point, my view is that the path forward is for EDP to proceed with implementation, contingent on Fraud Tech agreeing to take over ownership. If this needs to be escalated, it may be more appropriate on the Fraud Tech side – though I’m happy to be challenged on that if there’s a different perspective.

Chetan is back tomorrow and I’ll connect with him directly, but I’ve already had confirmation from his team that the code is ready for testing and they’re happy to support – provided the ownership question is resolved.

Let’s align on next steps once I’ve spoken with Chetan.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
