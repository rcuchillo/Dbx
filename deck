Got it â€” hereâ€™s the same Fraud Machine Learning story, but expanded slightly into bullet points so it lands clearly and still fits a 2-minute slot:

Fraud Machine Learning

Journey & rollout

Began developing internal fraud models in 2018.

First model live in April 2021 for debit card present transactions.

Expanded to debit card online, credit card, and outbound payments to cover both fraud and scams.


What we replaced

Legacy vendor system (FICO Falcon).

Depended on the vendor to update models, limiting speed and flexibility.


Immediate benefits

More effective â€“ over 2x better at detecting debit card fraud.

Agile & in control â€“ we can refresh and redevelop models quickly as fraud patterns change.

Better customer experience â€“ stronger protection with fewer unnecessary declines of genuine transactions.

Scalable coverage â€“ able to expand protection across more payment types without additional vendor cost or dependency.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to now draft the Transaction Monitoring version in the same expanded bullet-point style?


Great â€” thanks for the detail. Hereâ€™s the Transaction Monitoring version, rephrased into executive-friendly bullet points that mirror the Fraud ML style:


---

Transaction Monitoring

Journey & ambition

Building our own infrastructure within Barclays to deploy transaction monitoring models.

Replacing the vendor system SAM8 from NICE Actimize with in-house solutions.


What this means

Full control of the detection engine, enabling faster response to emerging risks.

Better protection of society by identifying suspicious activity more effectively.


Immediate benefits

Already live with tactical solutions in the UK and US.

Achieved a 30% reduction in alerts generated compared to the vendor solution, without compromising quality.

Improved alert quality & coverage, allowing Operations teams to focus on truly relevant cases.

Scalable approach â€“ able to absorb more work without increasing headcount.

ðŸ‘‰ Would you like me to now combine Fraud ML + Transaction Monitoring into a single 2-minute script flow (so it feels like one cohesive story for the video), or keep them as two separate sections for you to pick from?
