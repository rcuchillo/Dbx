Subject: Initial Thoughts on Thetaray Meeting

Hi [Team],

Following today’s discussion with Thetaray, I wanted to share a few initial thoughts.

Overall, I wasn’t particularly impressed with the session – it felt more like a sales pitch than a technical deep dive. They were unable to answer several technical questions, and the underlying methodology remains unclear. While they mentioned using unsupervised machine learning, they also referred to a feedback loop after investigation, which suggests a degree of supervision. I'm not entirely convinced that the bullet point on supervised learning was a typo, despite their comment.

They also confirmed the presence of rules layered on top of the model, which isn’t surprising, but again wasn’t clearly explained. In terms of results, they couldn’t share any true positive metrics – only the proportion of alerts deemed "worth investigating," which doesn’t give much insight into actual detection performance.

That said, I’d be keen to arrange a follow-up call with their data science team to get a more detailed understanding of the technical approach and capabilities.

Best,
[Your Name]
