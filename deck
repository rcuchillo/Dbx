Thanks for the context — that’s really helpful. Based on your team's advanced responsibilities — including R&D, platform modernization, training, and governance — I’ll suggest additions to the "Comments / Notes" section to reflect the high-level, technical, and strategic nature of your work.

Here’s a filled-out version of the table with proposed comments:

Job Profile Review: Model Developer

Job Profile	Model Developer	Comments / Notes

Purpose of Role	To design, develop, implement, and maintain various statistical, mathematical and machine learning models to support decision-making by analysis and solving complex problems.	The role plays a pivotal part in shaping the organization’s AI/ML strategy, driving innovation, and future-proofing decision systems. It includes active participation in evaluating emerging technologies, scaling ML capabilities, and aligning with enterprise-wide transformation goals.
Accountabilities		
1	Acquisition and collection of data from various sources, including internal databases, external datasets, and real-time feeds.	The team also evaluates new data sources (e.g., biometric, behavioral, or third-party APIs) and governs data acquisition pipelines to ensure traceability, quality, and ethical use. Integration with modern platforms (e.g., Databricks, Snowflake) is actively pursued.
2	Performing data cleaning and pre-processing tasks to ensure data quality and suitability for model development.	Beyond basic cleaning, the team promotes reproducible data pipelines, implements data quality frameworks, and automates data validation and reconciliation across training and production datasets.
3	Design and implementation of data management strategies for model maintenance and future development.	The team implements MLOps best practices, version control of features/models, continuous integration testing, and automated model refresh pipelines to ensure robust, scalable ML systems. Model documentation and lineage are treated as first-class citizens.
4	Designing, development, and implementation of statistical and machine learning models for various applications, including credit risk assessment, fraud detection, customer segmentation, and marketing optimisation.	Models are developed using cutting-edge techniques, including deep learning and generative AI where appropriate. The team also leads internal research initiatives, proof-of-concepts with emerging tools, and benchmarking exercises to guide model and platform evolution.
5	Monitoring model performance in real-time and identify any potential issues or biases.	The team ensures model monitoring is comprehensive — tracking data drift, model degradation, bias, and fairness. Proactive alerting, retraining workflows, and post-deployment explainability are key pillars of the monitoring framework.

Additional Suggestions:

You could propose adding two more rows to capture aspects currently missing from the accountabilities:

| 6 | Leading training, mentoring, and knowledge-sharing sessions to uplift ML capability across the organization. | The team actively contributes to internal training programs, supports technical upskilling across business units, and promotes a culture of open collaboration and responsible AI use. | | 7 | Evaluating and piloting emerging technologies, tools, and frameworks to ensure the organization remains at the forefront of AI innovation. | This includes close collaboration with platform teams, vendor assessments, and building scalable reference architectures that are production-ready and compliant with enterprise standards. |
