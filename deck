ðŸ”¹ INTRODUCTORY QUESTIONS (Background & Role Understanding)

Barclays Role â€“ Cybercrime Data Scientist:

1. Can you walk us through your current role at Barclays and how you balance applied machine learning, fraud analytics, and infrastructure development?


2. What are some of the most impactful outcomes from your work on mule fraud control optimisation?


3. Youâ€™ve worked across data science, fraud risk, and cyber threat intelligenceâ€”how do you prioritize which problems to tackle, and what does success look like?




---

ðŸ”¹ TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE

Machine Learning & PyTorch:

4. Can you tell us about the ML models you've built for fraud detectionâ€”what architectures did you use, and why?


5. You mentioned deploying models to production. What frameworks and tools did you use to support reproducibility and monitoring (e.g., MLflow, DVC)?


6. Have you used PyTorch in production? If so, what kinds of models or pipelines did you build, and how did you ensure scalability and maintainability?



Spark & Infrastructure:

7. You talk about orchestrating ETL with Dask and Sparkâ€”can you explain how you integrated these tools in your fraud pipeline?


8. How do you manage version control and testing for large-scale ETL or model training workflows?


9. Did your team adopt Databricks or AWS tools like Glue, SageMaker, or EMR for these pipelines? If so, how was your experience?



Deployment & Cross-Team Tooling:

10. Youâ€™ve implemented CI/CD for ML workflowsâ€”what were the biggest challenges, and how did you solve them?


11. How do you handle collaboration across cyber, data science, and engineering teams, particularly when building shared tools and pipelines?




---

ðŸ”¹ GOVERNANCE, RISK & COMPLIANCE

12. How do you ensure that the ML models you develop remain compliant with internal and external audit requirements?


13. Can you describe how you track and report on model performance and risk over time?


14. When working on fraud-related models, how do you ensure explainability and defensibility of predictions to business stakeholders or regulators?


15. Have you ever faced a situation where a deployed model failed or drifted significantly? How did you handle it?




---

ðŸ”¹ INDEPENDENCE & STRATEGIC THINKING

16. You mention building your own frameworks and processesâ€”can you describe a time when you initiated a new approach without being asked?


17. How do you align your technical strategy with broader business objectives, particularly when you're dealing with evolving cyber threats?


18. Imagine you were dropped into a completely new domain with no labeled data, limited compute resources, and pressure to deliver fastâ€”how would you approach solving that problem?


19. How do you stay up to date with the latest developments in AI, cybersecurity, and data toolingâ€”and how do you determine whatâ€™s worth experimenting with?
