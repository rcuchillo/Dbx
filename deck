Hi Amy,

Thanks for your response.

To add to Deep's point, I would like to emphasise that the benchmark should not only consider the recent BA4 hire but also other team members at the same grade across the broader team. In addition, Archie brings a very high level of specialisation that is critical to our work.

Given the scarcity of such skills in the market, it is highly unlikely that we would be able to attract or retain someone of Archie’s calibre in London for less than £60K. This level of expertise is not easily replaceable and should be recognised appropriately in the compensation recommendation.

Grateful if you could consider this context in the review.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
