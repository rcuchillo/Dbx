Subject: Re: TM 2026 MTP – MLRO/RE ask – laying out options to accelerate & do-ability

Hi All,

Apologies for the delay in coming back — this is the first time I’ve gone through the pack.

I agree with the points raised and would stress the need to avoid repeating the same mistakes we encountered with BUK Retail. Accelerating delivery across business areas makes sense, but we also need to balance this with the AE’s requirement to continue enhancing the ML solution from both a performance and risk coverage perspective.

Given current capacity, Quants will not be able to manage both streams simultaneously. To move forward, we will either need clear prioritization or additional resources on the ground.

Thanks,
Rémi

Would you like me to make this version more formal and executive-ready (suited for senior leadership), or keep it collaborative and team-focused (suited for peers)?






Here’s a draft you could send to recognize Avhisheke — it’s warm, motivating, and highlights both his achievement and future impact:

Draft Recognition Message
"I want to give a big shoutout to Avhisheke for the fantastic work he’s done driving the automation of our fraud model monitoring. He’s built a really solid, config-driven pipeline that works seamlessly across SAS and Python with Spark — not an easy feat. This is a great example of smart, scalable work that will benefit us well beyond this project. I’m excited to see it land on Airflow, where I know it will make an even bigger impact across other initiatives. Great job, Avhisheke!"

Do you want me to make this more formal recognition (like something you’d put in a wider team email or newsletter), or more casual (like a quick but meaningful post in Slack/Teams)?
