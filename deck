Here’s a draft you could send to recognize Avhisheke — it’s warm, motivating, and highlights both his achievement and future impact:

Draft Recognition Message
"I want to give a big shoutout to Avhisheke for the fantastic work he’s done driving the automation of our fraud model monitoring. He’s built a really solid, config-driven pipeline that works seamlessly across SAS and Python with Spark — not an easy feat. This is a great example of smart, scalable work that will benefit us well beyond this project. I’m excited to see it land on Airflow, where I know it will make an even bigger impact across other initiatives. Great job, Avhisheke!"

Do you want me to make this more formal recognition (like something you’d put in a wider team email or newsletter), or more casual (like a quick but meaningful post in Slack/Teams)?
