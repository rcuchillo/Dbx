Here’s a suggested **slide structure and content** for your 10–15 minute presentation to non-technical senior stakeholders, followed by a 30-minute Databricks demo. The goal is to illustrate **why Databricks matters**, **how it transforms your workflows**, and **what benefits it brings**—without getting technical.

## 🟦 Slide 1: **Why We’re Modernizing Our Data & AI Platform**

**Key message:** Our current tools are fragmented, slow, and hard to scale. Databricks offers an integrated, future-proof platform.

**Visual/Graphic:**

* A “before and after” diagram: multiple disconnected tools vs. unified Databricks platform.

**Talking points:**

* Current pain points: manual processes, data silos, inconsistent environments.
* Databricks simplifies and unifies our workflows—data ingestion, processing, ML, and BI.
* This enables us to move faster, stay compliant, and deliver value from data reliably.

## 🟦 Slide 2: **What Is Databricks? The Lakehouse Platform**

**Key message:** Databricks combines the best of data lakes and data warehouses, powering data analytics and AI from a single platform.

**Visual/Graphic:**

* Lakehouse architecture diagram (data lake + warehouse + ML + BI in one).

**Talking points:**

* One platform for structured and unstructured data, batch and streaming, analytics and AI.
* Open standards (Apache Spark, Delta Lake, MLflow) = no vendor lock-in.
* Cloud-native and scalable = reduced infrastructure headaches.

## 🟦 Slide 3: **How Databricks Changes Our Workflow**

**Key message:** Databricks removes friction between teams and accelerates delivery.

**Visual/Graphic:**

* Side-by-side comparison of “Old Workflow” vs. “New Workflow with Databricks”.

**Talking points:**

* No more waiting on data engineering for curated datasets.
* ML developers, analysts, and business users can collaborate in the same workspace.
* Real-time pipelines and version-controlled assets reduce errors and delays.

## 🟦 Slide 4: **Key Functionalities That Matter to Us**

**Key message:** These are the capabilities that will impact our day-to-day operations.

**Visual/Graphic:**

* A 2-column table: "Functionality" vs. "What It Enables"

**Examples to include:**

| Functionality           | What It Enables for Us                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Delta Lake              | Reliable, versioned data for reproducible results |
| Unified Notebooks       | Real-time collaboration between teams             |
| Feature Store           | Shareable, reusable ML features                   |
| Model Registry & MLflow | Transparent model lifecycle management            |
| Streaming (Auto Loader) | Near real-time fraud detection                    |
| Dashboards & Alerts     | Operational visibility and proactive monitoring   |

## 🟦 Slide 5: **What We Gain: Business Benefits**

**Key message:** Databricks isn't just about tools—it changes what we can deliver.

**Visual/Graphic:**

* Icons or simple infographics to represent benefits.

**Talking points:**

* **Faster time to insight:** reduce model build time by X%, quicker data refreshes.
* **Improved accuracy:** through consistent data and feature reuse.
* **Better collaboration:** one platform for data engineers, scientists, and analysts.
* **Reduced risk:** audit trails, monitoring, and reproducibility.
* **Lower cost of ownership:** fewer manual processes and legacy dependencies.

---

## 🟦 Slide 6 (Optional): **What Success Looks Like in 3 Months**

**Key message:** We can start seeing value quickly.

**Visual/Graphic:**

* Timeline or checklist.

**Talking points:**

* Pilot use case: \[e.g., streaming fraud detection or daily alert scoring].
* Daily refresh of curated datasets + model monitoring.
* Stakeholder dashboards live and alerting.
* Phase 2: more teams onboarded, full model lifecycle in Databricks.
