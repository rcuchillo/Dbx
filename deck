Subject: Proposal to Use GitLab CI/CD to Meet ASDS CC Control

Hi [Team/All],

I hope you're well.

We're currently using the tool GGG to satisfy the ASDS CC control. I’m exploring the possibility of transitioning to GitLab CI/CD for this purpose. My understanding is that as long as we clearly document our approach and can evidence that the testing process remains consistent across tools, there should be no issue with this change from a compliance perspective.

Before proceeding further, I’d like to gather your views on this—particularly around any risks, dependencies, or other considerations we should keep in mind. If anyone is aware of any constraints that would prevent us from using GitLab CI/CD in place of GGG, please let me know.

Happy to discuss further if needed.

Best regards,
