Thank you for your message.

Yes, there is a structured testing and governance framework in place to confirm the reliability of the new approach:

The BUK Retail ML model has been validated by IVU in line with MRM guidelines.

We conduct quarterly monitoring to assess model performance and stability.

In addition, monthly governance sessions are held to review the low-risk sampling approach. These cover key areas such as guardrails, BTL testing, score stability, and model performance.

Please let me know if you would like access to any specific documentation ahead of audit preparation.
