Liam – Mid-Year Feedback

What’s going well: Liam has delivered solid work in H1, with notable contributions such as the Debit v3 improvements and resolution of several complex issues. His efforts have not gone unnoticed — he’s been recognised both within the team and by colleagues across teams for his reliability and willingness to help. His strong understanding of business needs consistently informs the value of his technical work.

Areas to build on: Liam has expressed a clear aspiration to take on a leadership role, and that potential is certainly there. To take the next step, a few areas will need attention:

Leadership and Delegation: Liam often prefers to fix issues himself, which can limit others’ growth and create a bottleneck. Developing confidence in delegation and focusing on empowerment will be key to building leadership credibility.

Operational Management: The opportunity to drive day-to-day management improvements in the fraud area — such as Jira housekeeping or better framework adoption — hasn’t yet materialised. This is a space where a more structured and proactive approach could have real impact.

Tool Development vs. Reusability: There’s a tendency to create new tools rather than enhancing and evolving existing ones. Given Liam’s deep understanding of business needs, this is a missed opportunity to build scalable and transferrable solutions that benefit the wider team.

Adoption of Best Practices: The work on LTM was an opportunity for leadership that didn’t fully land, and there are early signs that the same might happen with MLOps. Raising valid concerns is important, but to lead in this space, there needs to be clear commitment to adopting modern practices and driving change — even when it means stepping outside of familiar territory.

Openness to Change: For someone aiming to lead, embracing change and thinking about the broader team benefit is essential. Pushing back on tools like Apache Airflow, for example, should be balanced with a willingness to explore and champion what’s best for the team and the future of the platform.


Support moving forward: Liam has a lot to bring to the table and shows the right instincts to grow into a leadership role. The focus now should be on becoming more proactive in driving adoption, thinking beyond immediate solutions, and stepping confidently out of his comfort zone. I’m here to support that journey and look forward to seeing him shape the future direction of our engineering practices.
