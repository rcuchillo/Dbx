Anthony – Mid-Year Feedback

What’s going well: Anthony has made strong contributions in the first half of the year, particularly with the transaction monitoring model and the upcoming BB model. These are meaningful deliverables that reflect solid technical capability. Despite a demanding workload, Anthony managed the handover to Salma professionally and effectively — the time spent walking her through the details was clearly appreciated and helped set her up for success.

Areas to build on: There are a few areas where continued growth would make a big difference:

Commitment vs. Delivery: While the ambition is appreciated, timelines are often adjusted due to over-commitment. A more realistic approach to scoping and planning would help build confidence in delivery.

Code Efficiency: There’s room to invest more time in code optimization and exploring more efficient or scalable solutions. This would help long-term maintainability and performance.

Proactivity in Platform Changes: For example, being more proactive around initiatives like the Kubernetes migration could have helped avoid some of the challenges we’re now facing.

Prioritisation: Balancing competing demands remains a challenge. Clarifying what’s most impactful and urgent would help ensure effort is spent where it matters most.


Support moving forward: One thing I’ve picked up on is that Anthony may feel somewhat disconnected from the wider team. That’s something I want to address — it’s important that everyone feels included and connected to the broader mission. We’ll work together on this to create more opportunities for engagement and ensure the right level of support is in place.
