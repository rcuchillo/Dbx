Got it â€” hereâ€™s the same Fraud Machine Learning story, but expanded slightly into bullet points so it lands clearly and still fits a 2-minute slot:

Fraud Machine Learning

Journey & rollout

Began developing internal fraud models in 2018.

First model live in April 2021 for debit card present transactions.

Expanded to debit card online, credit card, and outbound payments to cover both fraud and scams.


What we replaced

Legacy vendor system (FICO Falcon).

Depended on the vendor to update models, limiting speed and flexibility.


Immediate benefits

More effective â€“ over 2x better at detecting debit card fraud.

Agile & in control â€“ we can refresh and redevelop models quickly as fraud patterns change.

Better customer experience â€“ stronger protection with fewer unnecessary declines of genuine transactions.

Scalable coverage â€“ able to expand protection across more payment types without additional vendor cost or dependency.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to now draft the Transaction Monitoring version in the same expanded bullet-point style?
