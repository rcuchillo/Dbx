ðŸ”¹ INTRODUCTORY QUESTIONS (Experience Overview)

Start by setting a relaxed tone, then explore key achievements:

Barclays & Recent Experience:

1. Can you walk me through your role at Barclays, especially the data science innovation work you led?


2. You mention delivering time series models and reducing business impact during outages. Can you elaborate on the business problem and how you approached the solution?


3. At Medicines Discovery Catapult, how did you integrate AI/ML into chemoinformatics and bioinformatics workflows?


4. Youâ€™ve held leadership roles across multiple sectorsâ€”how do you tailor your data science strategy for different industries?

ðŸ”¹ TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE

PyTorch & ML Models:

5. Whatâ€™s your experience working with PyTorch in production? Any examples of custom architectures or training optimization challenges youâ€™ve faced?


6. You mention using variational autoencoders (VAEs). What was the use case, and how did you evaluate their effectiveness?


7. How do you handle time series modelingâ€”do you lean toward deep learning or classical statistical models, and why?



Spark & Big Data:

8. Can you describe how you used Spark for anomaly detection in sensor data? What were some of the scalability challenges?


9. Have you used Spark MLlib, or do you generally use Spark for data prep before training models in another framework like PyTorch?


10. What tools do you use for managing data pipelines at scale (e.g., Airflow, Delta Lake, etc.)?



AWS / Databricks / SageMaker:

11. Whatâ€™s your experience with AWS servicesâ€”have you used SageMaker for model development or deployment?


12. Have you worked with Databricks? If so, how did it support your ML workflowâ€”feature engineering, experiment tracking, or deployment?


13. Can you compare using Databricks notebooks vs traditional notebooks or IDEs in terms of team collaboration and governance?

ðŸ”¹ GOVERNANCE, DATA QUALITY & RISK MANAGEMENT

14. Youâ€™ve built data validation frameworksâ€”can you walk through the key components and how they ensure data integrity?


15. How do you track model drift or performance degradation in production environments?


16. Tell me about a time when you had to defend model decisions to a regulatory body or internal risk team. How did you approach it?


17. How do you manage model documentation and audit trails, particularly in regulated settings like finance or pharma?




---

ðŸ”¹ INDEPENDENCE & INNOVATIVE THINKING

18. Describe a time when you proposed a completely new approach that went against the status quo. What was the outcome?


19. How do you stay up to date with the latest developments in AI and decide what to experiment with?


20. Imagine you join a team with poor data quality and no model monitoringâ€”what would your first 30 days look like?


21. If you were tasked with solving an environmental or fraud-related problem but had limited labeled data, how would you approach the modeling process?
