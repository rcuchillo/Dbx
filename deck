Here's the **full slide content** for your Databricks presentation, designed for senior non-technical stakeholders. The tone is **business-focused**, clear, and aligned to **benefits and impact**.

---

## 🟦 **Slide 1: Why We’re Modernizing Our Data & AI Platform**

**Title:** Breaking Silos, Accelerating Intelligence

**Main Points:**

* Our current data & ML workflows are fragmented:

  * Data lives in silos, slowing decision-making.
  * Manual handoffs between teams increase errors and delays.
  * Monitoring models and ensuring consistency is time-consuming.
* We need a scalable, integrated platform to power the next generation of analytics and AI.
* **Databricks enables this by unifying our data, analytics, and machine learning efforts.**

**Bottom line:** Faster decisions, better models, more automation—with fewer dependencies.

## 🟦 **Slide 2: What Is Databricks? The Lakehouse Advantage**

**Title:** One Platform for All Our Data and AI Needs

**Main Points:**

* Databricks is a **Lakehouse Platform**—combining the scalability of data lakes with the performance of data warehouses.
* Built on open standards (Spark, Delta Lake, MLflow).
* Supports all types of data: structured, unstructured, streaming, batch.
* One workspace for data engineers, scientists, and analysts to collaborate.

**How this helps us:**

* No more jumping between tools.
* Reduced operational complexity.
* Everyone works on the same version of data.

## 🟦 **Slide 3: How Databricks Changes Our Workflow**

**Title:** From Manual to Automated, From Friction to Flow

**Before Databricks:**

* Data engineers deliver extracts manually.
* Models rebuilt from scratch in siloed environments.
* Business waits days or weeks for updates or insights.

**With Databricks:**

* Real-time data ingestion and processing.
* Reusable data pipelines and features for ML.
* Automated monitoring and retraining of models.
* Instant collaboration through shared notebooks.

**Impact:**

* **Days of work become hours.**
* Fewer errors, faster model updates.
* Teams aligned and working from the same source of truth.

## 🟦 **Slide 4: What We Can Do with Databricks**

**Title:** Key Capabilities That Drive Value

| **Functionality**           | **What It Enables for Us**                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Delta Lake**              | Reliable, versioned, high-quality datasets                    |
| **Unified Notebooks**       | Collaboration between data, analytics, and ML teams           |
| **Feature Store**           | Reusable ML features for better model accuracy & speed        |
| **Model Registry & MLflow** | Transparent model tracking, testing, deployment, and rollback |
| **Streaming (Auto Loader)** | Near real-time use cases like fraud detection and alerting    |
| **Dashboards & Alerts**     | Visual, automated monitoring for business users               |

**Note:** These aren’t abstract tools—they directly reduce delays, improve reliability, and help us deliver impact faster.

## 🟦 **Slide 5: What This Means for the Business**

**Title:** Tangible Benefits for Our Teams and Customers

✅ **Faster time to value:** Build and deploy models in weeks instead of months
✅ **Improved data reliability:** Trustworthy data means fewer costly errors
✅ **Scalable innovation:** One platform for multiple teams and use cases
✅ **Proactive monitoring:** Catch issues early with alerts and dashboards
✅ **Lower total cost of ownership:** Fewer tools to maintain, automate manual tasks

**Real-world outcome:**
From fraud detection to customer insights, Databricks gives us the infrastructure to act faster, smarter, and with more confidence.

---

## 🟦 **Slide 6 (Optional): What Success Looks Like in 90 Days**

**Title:** Rapid Value from Day One

**First 90 Days Goals:**

* ✅ Pilot use case in production (e.g., streaming fraud detection).
* ✅ Daily refresh of curated datasets with version control.
* ✅ Stakeholder dashboard live with alerts.
* ✅ Initial model lifecycle managed in the platform.
* ✅ Teams trained and collaborating in shared notebooks.

**Next Step:**

* Expand to additional teams and models, building a scalable ecosystem.

🧩 Current Challenges (Left Column)

🔌 Fragmented Tooling
Disconnected systems for data ingestion, modeling, and monitoring

🚧 On-Prem Limitations
Downtime, scaling bottlenecks, and infrastructure overhead

🔒 No Direct Path to Production
Manual model promotion, slow iterations, high risk of drift

👨‍💻 Developer-Only Usability
Technical barriers for non-dev teams to explore or experiment

❗ Inconsistent Data Access
Siloed data sources, manual exports, and no real-time availability



---

🌐 Our Future with Databricks (Right Column)

☁️ Cloud-Native Scalability
Auto-scale compute, pay-as-you-go, high availability

🛠️ Built-In MLOps
Full model lifecycle management: tracking, deployment, monitoring

🔄 End-to-End Pipelines
Seamless path from experimentation to production

👥 Accessible to All Roles
Unified environment for data scientists, engineers, and analysts

🔐 Secure, Unified Data Access

🧩 Slide Title: Current ML Model Development: Complex, Slow, and Siloed

🔁 Workflow Diagram (Suggested Steps for a Visual Slide)

Here’s a textual version you can hand off to design or build in PowerPoint with boxes/arrows:


---

1. Data Access

🧑‍💼 Data team provides export

🔁 Often delayed or incomplete



---

2. Data Curation (Manual)

🛠️ Data scientists clean & structure data

❗ Duplication of effort across teams



---

3. Feature Engineering & Exploration

🧪 Work begins only after curation

🚧 Hard to collaborate with analysts due to platform complexity



---

4. Model Training

🤖 Model built in isolated dev environment

No integration with real-time or prod data yet



---

5. Offline Evaluation & Feedback

📤 Model results shared as flat files or reports

🔄 Stakeholders give feedback manually



---

6. Artefact Handoff to Tech

📦 Model, code, and metadata pushed to repo

🧑‍💻 Engineering team takes over



---

7. Rebuild in Prod

🧱 Tech team accesses data in prod (again)

🧪 Revalidates + tests model performance



---

8. Deploy to Prod

🚀 Model goes live



---

9. Monitoring & BAU

📡 Data sent back to dev environment for tracking

🧹 Manual monitoring and retraining loop



---

🔴 Executive Message:

> “Every step involves handoffs, duplicated data access, and delays. It takes weeks to months to ship a model — and it’s difficult to scale or reproduce.”
