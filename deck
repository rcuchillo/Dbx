**Mayank – Mid-Year Feedback**

**What’s going well:**
Mayank has played an important role in the team’s progress this year, particularly in taking ownership of model monitoring and setting the foundation for an automated pipeline. His contributions are helping build a more scalable and sustainable monitoring process. His support for the Noida hiring efforts has also been valuable — the skillsets brought in through that process are already strengthening the team’s capabilities.

**Areas to build on:**
As Mayank continues to take on more responsibility, there are a few areas where a shift in approach could enhance his effectiveness:

* **Simplicity and Reusability:** There's a tendency to redevelop tools where existing solutions might suffice. While building from scratch can offer flexibility, it's important to balance that with simplicity and maintainability. Reusing and enhancing what's already available helps the team move faster and reduces duplication.
* **Diversity of Thought and Team Empowerment:** Creating space for others to present and own their work is essential for team growth. Stepping in too quickly or correcting others during presentations can unintentionally limit contribution and confidence. Encouraging different viewpoints and allowing team members to take the lead builds trust and fosters innovation.
* **Self-Reflection and Growth Mindset:** The 360 feedback highlights that your self-assessment leans strongly toward full confidence across all LEAD behaviours. While confidence is valuable, it's also important to stay open to feedback and continuously ask: *what more can I do, or do differently, to improve outcomes or empower others?* Great leaders are those who challenge themselves just as much as they challenge their teams.

**Support moving forward:**
Mayank is a highly capable contributor and has the potential to grow into a strong technical leader. By focusing on simplicity, enabling others, and embracing a mindset of continuous self-improvement, he can elevate both his own impact and that of the team. I’m looking forward to seeing that evolution in the second half of the year.
