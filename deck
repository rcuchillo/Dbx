Subject: Clarification on Model Performance Observation and Remediation Approach

Hi [Recipient],

I understand the intention to raise an observation regarding the decrease in model performance. However, under the two options currently listed—either a material change or an inception validation—you will not receive or review the evidence required to close the challenge. In practice, the challenge will simply be closed because the model is decommissioned.

I appreciate the point of raising an issue on performance, but I don’t think the remediation proposed is appropriate. Would it not make more sense to have something along the lines of:

Register a model rebuild by Dec 26; or

Deploy a rebuild by Q1 2027?


This is the first time I’ve seen a remediation created that would be closed before evidence can actually be shared, due to our model risk policy. That makes me think the current approach may not be fully aligned.

Could we revisit the remediation to ensure it addresses the performance concern in a more effective way?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
