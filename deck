Certainly. Here's a clearly articulated, executive-level paragraph that expands your points into a 20+ sentence narrative suitable for a leadership slide deck or briefing document:

We are leveraging machine learning to proactively identify retail banking customers who exhibit behaviors associated with a high likelihood of SAR filing, despite not having triggered existing alerting mechanisms. This initiative targets unalerted customers, aiming to surface previously undetected risk. The model is designed to analyze historical behavioral patterns and transactional data across the entire retail customer base. It is run monthly to identify a subset of customers who, while not generating alerts through the traditional rules engine, share characteristics with customers previously filed as SARs.

This proactive, intelligence-driven approach complements our current alert-driven workflows. Rather than relying solely on pre-defined rules, the model introduces a data-driven capability that evolves with emerging patterns of suspicious behavior. The initial pilot was conducted on a population of 415 unalerted customers. From this population, 40 customers were selected based on their high model scores and subjected to manual investigation by experienced analysts.

Of the 40 cases reviewed, 11 resulted in SAR filings. This translates to a hit rate of 27.5%, significantly above the baseline expected from traditional random or rules-based sampling. The remaining customers are still under review, with additional SARs potentially forthcoming. These early results are promising and provide a strong foundation to scale the approach. The high precision of the model supports efficient use of investigative resources by narrowing focus to those customers with the highest likelihood of requiring regulatory reporting.

We are now proposing to operationalise this model as part of our monthly intelligence cycle. The plan involves producing a prioritized list of high-scoring unalerted customers every month. This list would be delivered to operational teams for targeted review, complementing existing alert-based queues. Importantly, this approach does not replace current processes—it enhances them by adding a predictive layer designed to catch what rules may miss.

By incorporating this monthly ML-driven view, we increase the likelihood of identifying suspicious activity that might otherwise go undetected. This addresses known limitations in our existing rules-based system and supports our strategic goal of more comprehensive risk coverage. Furthermore, it aligns with regulatory expectations around innovation and proactive surveillance.

The ML model is regularly retrained on the latest customer and SAR data to maintain relevance and accuracy. The end-to-end process, from scoring to investigation, is designed to be transparent, explainable, and auditable. Feedback from investigators will also be used to refine the model over time, creating a virtuous cycle of continuous improvement.

In terms of resource allocation, we propose a phased rollout that balances investigative workload with expected benefit. As the model matures and feedback loops are integrated, we anticipate improved efficiency and even higher SAR conversion rates. This initiative represents a meaningful step forward in the use of AI to enhance financial crime detection while maintaining operational discipline and regulatory compliance.

Certainly — here’s a concise, executive-level version of your paragraph in under 10 sentences:

We are using machine learning to proactively identify unalerted retail banking customers with a high likelihood of SAR filing, based on behavioral patterns observed in historical data. The model runs monthly across the entire retail customer base to flag individuals who resemble previously SARed profiles but have not triggered traditional alerts. In a pilot test of 40 high-scoring unalerted customers from a population of 415, 11 SARs were filed, resulting in a 27.5% hit rate. The remaining cases are still under investigation, suggesting further upside.

This targeted approach enhances our current rules-based process by surfacing missed risk and enabling more efficient use of investigative resources. We propose operationalizing the process by sending a monthly list of top high-scoring unalerted customers to our investigations team. This allows us to address potential blind spots in our current framework without increasing overall alert volume. The model is retrained regularly to stay aligned with evolving risk patterns and investigator feedback. This initiative reflects a proactive and scalable enhancement to our financial crime detection strategy.
