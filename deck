Subject: Request for SME Input on Model Features

Dear [Recipient's Name],

The feature descriptions have been populated to the best of our current understanding. At this stage, your input as business SMEs is essential to help identify any potential gaps or misalignments in the model features.

While our team continues to investigate the loyalty reward transactions, we would greatly appreciate it if you could begin reviewing the feature list. This will help ensure we stay on track and avoid delays in realising the intended business benefits.

Thank you in advance for your support and collaboration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
