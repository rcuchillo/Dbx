Great — you're designing meaningful timeliness and accuracy checks. Let’s break it down with pseudo code for both, and also address your question about KS vs PSI.


---

📌 1. Timeliness Check – Score = -2 Volume

🔍 Goal:

Monitor how often the score -2 appears daily. If it's unusually high, trigger a RAG status (Red/Amber/Green).

✅ Pseudo Code:

# Inputs
threshold = 1000  # Example threshold for "too many -2 scores"
date = today()

# Load today's data
df = load_data(date)

# Compute volume of score = -2
score_minus_2_volume = df.filter(score == -2).count()

# RAG status logic
if score_minus_2_volume > threshold * 1.5:
    status = "RED"
elif score_minus_2_volume > threshold:
    status = "AMBER"
else:
    status = "GREEN"

# Output
log("Timeliness Check - Score=-2", {
    "volume": score_minus_2_volume,
    "threshold": threshold,
    "status": status
})

📌 2. Accuracy Check – Score Distribution Drift

🔍 Goal:

Compare today’s score distribution to a historical benchmark. If the drift is significant, flag it.

🔬 KS vs PSI: Which to Use?

Metric	Best For	Notes

KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov)	Classifier model validation; comparing cumulative distributions	Sensitive to shape changes; non-parametric
PSI (Population Stability Index)	Monitoring score drift over time	Interpretable bins; more stable for production monitoring


✅ Use PSI for production monitoring accuracy drift — especially for score distributions.


---

✅ Pseudo Code for PSI Drift:

# Inputs
benchmark_distribution = load_distribution("benchmark")  # e.g., histogram of score bins
current_distribution = compute_distribution(df["score"])  # same binning

# Compute PSI
psi = compute_PSI(benchmark_distribution, current_distribution)

# RAG thresholds (tune as needed)
if psi > 0.25:
    status = "RED"     # Significant drift
elif psi > 0.1:
    status = "AMBER"   # Moderate drift
else:
    status = "GREEN"   # No significant drift

# Output
log("Accuracy Check - Score Drift", {
    "psi": psi,
    "status": status
})

📊 Optional: Daily Report Output

You can log both checks to a shared report:

report = {
    "date": today(),
    "timeliness": {
        "score_-2_volume": score_minus_2_volume,
        "status": timeliness_status
    },
    "accuracy": {
        "psi": psi,
        "status": accuracy_status
    }
}

save_to_dashboard(report)

Would you like a working Python version of this with sample data and auto-reporting (e.g., to a CSV or HTML dashboard)?

🔚 Final Thoughts

This is a solid draft and well aligned to our broader platform modernisation efforts. With a few refinements around clarity, structure, and planning, it can serve as a robust working document for both engineering and leadership audiences. Let me know once updated – happy to review again.

Best regards,
