Subject: Forecasting Approach and Model Risk Consideration

Hi Pritish,

The approach has now been agreed. We will use Prophet to forecast data volumes, with a threshold-based mechanism layered on top to trigger alerts. These thresholds will be refined over time to reduce false positives while still capturing key events.

It's now clear that this setup does not fall under the model risk policy, as it is similar to what we currently have for FML (see attached), which was deemed out of scope for model risk.

That said, since this is a new tool we may apply more broadly if proven effective, we’ll document the full approach. I’m happy to share that with IVU once it’s ready.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
