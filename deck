Shivam – Mid-Year Feedback

What’s going well: Shivam has had a solid first half of the year. He’s developed a good understanding of the transaction monitoring portfolio and stepped up to provide cover during Anthony’s paternity leave, which was much appreciated. His technical experience and domain knowledge are valuable assets to the team.

Areas to build on: There are a few areas where Shivam can further increase his impact:

Proactivity and Pace: Progress has occasionally been slower than expected. For example, even without full clarity on data sources, it would have been possible to start implementing feature logic based on existing components of the prioritisation model and known gaps. A more proactive mindset — identifying what can be done rather than waiting for all inputs — will help move things forward faster.

Team Collaboration: Shivam brings a great deal of experience, and that’s a real strength. However, there have been moments where ideas were pushed back based more on who proposed them rather than their merit. Adopting a more open and team-oriented approach will create a stronger collaborative environment and ensure we make the most of everyone’s contributions.

Ownership Mindset: Embracing a “what can I do to help?” attitude — even if it’s outside the immediate scope — will go a long way in accelerating progress and fostering leadership. There's always a next step to take, and being more active in identifying and owning those steps would make a significant difference.


Support moving forward: Shivam has the knowledge and ability to lead by example. With a shift in mindset toward proactive ownership and more inclusive collaboration, he’s well positioned to make a bigger impact in the second half of the year.
