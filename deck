Hamish – Mid-Year Feedback

What’s going well: Hamish has made a strong impact in the first half of the year. His work on optimizing and automating the data curation process has significantly improved our workflows, and his support during the Kubernetes migration has been exceptional. These contributions have not gone unnoticed — he’s received well-deserved recognition, particularly for his willingness to guide new joiners and help them ramp up on the platform. His ability to build strong relationships with stakeholders has also been a clear asset to the team.

Areas to build on: To continue progressing and increasing impact, a few areas are worth focusing on:

Delivery Timeliness: Some key deliverables, such as the model refreshes, have seen delays. These were opportunities to further reduce manual effort across the team and deliver visible value to stakeholders. Improving planning and follow-through will help avoid similar missed opportunities going forward.

Communication Style: While Hamish is highly knowledgeable, he can sometimes go into excessive technical detail when simpler, outcome-focused communication would be more effective — especially when engaging with non-technical audiences.

Documentation: The effort to document processes is appreciated and important. The next step is to make that documentation more accessible by improving structure, clarity, and ease of navigation.


Support moving forward: Despite these areas for improvement, Hamish is clearly operating above and beyond the expectations of his current role. His technical depth, ownership mindset, and collaborative approach stand out. With continued focus on sharpening communication and increasing delivery consistency, he’s well positioned to take on broader responsibilities and drive even more impact in the second half of the year.
