Subject: Follow-up on Project Deck and Data Access

Hi [Recipient’s Name],

Thank you for sharing the deck. Given this project has now become a higher priority, it would be great to connect tomorrow if your schedule allows.

There’s one critical piece of information I’ve been trying to confirm over the past month: the location of the data. Having visibility on the data is often helpful, as it allows us to explore tactical solutions in parallel while we work on the longer-term strategic approach.

Do you have any details on the data warehouse setup? And is Sawai Rajpurohit the right person to speak with regarding this?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Would you like me to make this more formal (executive tone) or more collaborative (peer-to-peer tone)?
