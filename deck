Salma – Mid-Year Feedback

What’s going well: Although Salma joined the team only at the end of Q1, she has already made a strong impression. She ramped up quickly, showing a solid grasp of the MULES space and building strong relationships with key stakeholders. Her early contributions demonstrate both technical capability and an understanding of the broader context in which we operate.

Looking ahead: While it’s still early to assess long-term performance, Salma is clearly off to a strong start. I’m particularly looking forward to seeing her lead the full redevelopment of the personal banking model. This is a great opportunity to further increase adoption of the MULES model within the fraud space and expand her impact across the team.
