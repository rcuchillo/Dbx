**Slide 8: Model Observability**

* **Headline:** "Ongoing Monitoring Detects Drift and Model Decay Early"
* What: Track real-world model behavior (latency, accuracy, drift)
* How: Compare real vs. expected distributions; alert and adapt
* Current:

  * No formal observability framework
  * Manual comparisons and basic metrics
* Future:

  * Integrate EvidentlyAI or WhyLabs for drift, stability, and accuracy dashboards
  * Real-time inference stats collection
* Open Source Tools to Evaluate:
