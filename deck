Subject: Clarification on Model Usage and Validation Timeline

Hi all,

Just to be clear, we have no intention of using the model for decisioning before IVU are comfortable with it and have approved its usage. The validation timeline is expected to be less than 12 weeks, given the limited scope of this tactical solution.

The proposal agreed with IVU is that, with their approval, we can use the model as a prioritisation tool while the validation is ongoing. Anthony has already had some background conversations with them to ensure they are aware that this is coming their way.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Do you want me to make it more formal (e.g., emphasizing regulatory alignment and risk control), or keep it straightforward and collaborative as above?
