ðŸŽ¤ Speaker Script

> "This slide should look familiar to many of you. Itâ€™s a capacity planning view that reflects how model development work is typically scoped and sequenced using our current legacy platforms."



> "The key point here is that this waterfall is largely based on traditional, on-premise limitations. What that means in practice is: even though many ML workflows could in theory run in parallel, the actual work often remains sequential because weâ€™re constrained by compute availability, siloed tooling, and long handovers between teams."



> "Letâ€™s look at the bar on the left: it starts at 840 units of capacity demand for 2025, and through various efficiency gains like tactical cuts, prioritization, and offloading, we manage to reduce that down to about 665. But these are reactive levers â€” and even then, a large portion of the remaining work is still locked in that classic linear structure."



> "Now, if we zoom in on model development, validation, and deploymentâ€”highlighted at the bottom table in phases Month 2 to Month 9â€”we see a big opportunity."



> "Hereâ€™s where Databricks makes a real difference. With a unified cloud-native platform, we can start to collapse these phases. Instead of separate teams waiting on clean handovers, we enable collaboration in real time across data engineering, model development, and production teams."



> "Model development (months 2â€“5) no longer needs to be a bottleneck. Using Databricks' feature store, experiment tracking, and shared notebooks, we can build, test, and tune multiple models in parallel â€” not serially."



> "Model validation (months 5â€“7) becomes more automated and auditable, using built-in compliance tools and reproducible MLflow tracking. We donâ€™t have to re-engineer models just to make them explainable."



> "And finally, deployment (months 7â€“9) no longer has to be a painful manual push. With the model registry and version control, we can promote models into production in a governed, trackable way â€” and even test them in shadow environments before going live."



> "So the big takeaway from this slide isnâ€™t just the numbers, but the structure. By moving away from legacy sequencing and toward cloud-native parallelism, weâ€™re not just cutting time â€” weâ€™re removing friction entirely."

Hereâ€™s a refined version of your script, focusing more clearly on the table and the message that we could deliver faster:


---

ðŸŽ¤ Final Speaker Script (2â€“3 mins, table-focused)

> "I want to draw your attention to the table at the bottom, which lays out the typical phases of machine learning model development â€” from business requirements through to deployment."



> "Today, on our legacy platforms, this work is mostly sequential â€” not because it has to be, but because of tooling and infrastructure limitations. On-prem resources and siloed environments slow things down."



> "But with Databricks, these phases donâ€™t need to wait on each other. Model development, validation, and deployment can happen much faster and even in parallel."



> "We can shorten model development by using a shared feature store and experiment tracking. Validation becomes quicker and more robust with built-in auditability. And deployment can be automated through the model registry, rather than relying on manual handoffs."



> "The real opportunity here is speed. By modernizing, weâ€™re not just shifting tools â€” weâ€™re unlocking faster, more reliable delivery across every phase in this table."

Hereâ€™s a focused 2â€“3 minute speaker script for Slide 2: "Why We're Modernizing Our AI Platform", emphasizing the challenge of having three separate environments and the need for collaboration:


---

ðŸŽ¤ Speaker Script (Slide 2)

> "This slide captures why we need to modernize our AI platform â€” and the core issue is fragmentation."



> "Today, our AI and analytics workflows are split across three disconnected environments:

one for Data Science and ML,

one for Business Analytics,

and another for Model Operations."




> "Each team operates in its own silo, with its own tooling and infrastructure. That means collaboration is difficult, and worse â€” we're constantly moving data and artefacts between environments, often manually."



> "This results in all the pain points listed here:

Inconsistent access to data,

Fragmented tools,

and a lack of real-time visibility across teams."




> "It also means non-developers struggle to contribute, and deployment is slow and risky due to on-prem limitations and manual handovers."



> "The bottom line? These silos prevent us from working together in real time â€” and they introduce unnecessary delays and risks."



> "With Databricks, we unify these workflows on a single platform. That means shared access to data, features, and models â€” and a much faster, more collaborative path from exploration to production."

Hereâ€™s a 2â€“3 minute speaker script for Slide 3: "What is Databricks?", emphasizing its unifying power and governance capabilities:


---

ðŸŽ¤ Speaker Script (Slide 3)

> "So what exactly is Databricks? At its core, itâ€™s a cloud-native platform that brings together all the tools and workflows we need â€” data engineering, analytics, and machine learning â€” into a single collaborative environment."



> "What makes it powerful is that itâ€™s built on a shared foundation of unified data and governance, as shown in the diagram on the right. This eliminates silos by giving all teams â€” data scientists, analysts, engineers â€” a consistent, governed view of the data."



> "Features like Delta Lake ensure our data is reliable, versioned, and supports ACID transactions. Collaborative notebooks let teams work together in real time across Python, SQL, Scala, or R."



> "MLflow is built in, giving us seamless experiment tracking, model management, and deployment without jumping between tools."



> "And with auto-scaling compute and fine-grained governance, we donâ€™t just move faster â€” we stay compliant and in control."



> "Databricks isnâ€™t just another tool â€” itâ€™s a shared intelligence engine that supports everything from data pipelines to real-time analytics to production AI â€” all from one place."

Hereâ€™s a 2â€“3 minute speaker script for Slide 4: "How Databricks Changes Our Workflow", with an emphasis on reducing movement of data and artefacts across teams and platforms:


---

ðŸŽ¤ Speaker Script (Slide 4)

> "This slide shows how Databricks fundamentally changes the way we work â€” by bringing everyone into a single, collaborative environment."



> "Today, a lot of time is lost moving data and artefacts between systems and teams. Whether it's handing off curated data to analytics, or features to model ops â€” every transition introduces friction."



> "With Databricks, everything happens in one platform. From data extraction and curation, to feature engineering â€” both for models and rules â€” all the way through to model development, testing, deployment, and monitoring."



> "You can see here that both the Data Science team and the Business Analytics team are working off a shared feature store and registry, reducing duplication and improving consistency."



> "Crucially, once a model is ready, it flows directly into Model Ops â€” where deployment, testing, and go-live are all integrated. No more manual exports, code rewrites, or fragile handoffs."



> "This is the real shift: we're no longer passing work around â€” we're working together in real time."

Hereâ€™s a 2â€“3 minute speaker script for Slide 5: "What We Can Do Better with Databricks", emphasizing practical benefits for collaboration and delivery:


---

ðŸŽ¤ Speaker Script (Slide 5)

> "This slide highlights the key capabilities that Databricks brings to the table â€” and really, what we can now do better and faster."



> "We start with data versioning â€” using Delta Lake's Time Travel to track changes in datasets. This gives us auditability and reproducibility out of the box."



> "Feature Registry ensures that engineered features are shared and reused across teams, eliminating duplication and ensuring consistency between training and scoring."



> "Experiment tracking with MLflow allows us to compare model runs, tune hyperparameters, and understand performance clearly â€” no more spreadsheets or ad hoc logs."



> "When itâ€™s time to deploy, we use the model registry to push the best version straight into production â€” safely and efficiently."



> "And finally, model monitoring lets us track performance, drift, and even fraud detection rates â€” all through live dashboards."



> "The flow diagram here shows how all of this ties together into one integrated pipeline. Teams collaborate in one place, without waiting or handing off work across systems."



> "This is the real value: better collaboration, fewer errors, and much faster delivery."

Hereâ€™s a concise 2â€“3 minute speaker script for Slide 6: "Summary", wrapping up your Databricks demo effectively:


---

ðŸŽ¤ Speaker Script (Slide 6)

> "To wrap up â€” this slide gives a clear summary of what Databricks offers, along with a few practical limitations to keep in mind."



> "On the left, you can see the benefits weâ€™ve been demonstrating throughout this session.
Databricks is highly scalable, handling large datasets with ease.
Itâ€™s an all-in-one platform, bringing together data engineering, analytics, and machine learning â€” all in the same space."



> "It supports real-time collaboration, and enables automated workflows for training, deployment, and monitoring.
Being cloud-based, we avoid infrastructure headaches and scale up or down as needed.
And crucially, it provides strong governance â€” so we can trace and secure everything from raw data to deployed models."



> "That said, there are a few limitations to be aware of.
Thereâ€™s a bit of a learning curve â€” especially for teams new to the cloud or to ML tooling.
Being cloud-native means you need your data to be cloud-accessible.
And for smaller teams, the full platform might be more than they need.
Finally, while Databricks offers basic dashboards, more custom UI work might still be best handled in tools like Power BI."



> "So overall, while itâ€™s not a silver bullet, Databricks gives us a modern, scalable, and collaborative foundation to build, deploy, and monitor AI faster and more effectively."
