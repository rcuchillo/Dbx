Subject: Case Manager Data Pipeline Alignment

Hi Manasa,

I agree with Sam—there’s already been strong progress in building an efficient data pipeline for the case manager, and that should serve as our starting point.

While we’re happy to support in identifying any gaps, it’s important to note that GCQA primarily operates as a development team. Our expertise lies in consuming data rather than managing source systems, migrations, or data governance.

The fact that the current tool is on-prem shouldn’t be a blocker, as we already access several critical data feeds—such as transactions, customers, and account information—across both cloud and on-prem environments.

The proposed approach below looks sound overall. My only suggestion would be to revise the first action to task Greig with performing a gap analysis between the data currently feeding the case manager pipeline and what’s available in EDP.

Let me know if you’d like a contact who can help map the data currently used in the existing solution.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
