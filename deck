## 🟦 **Slide 1: Why We’re Modernizing Our Data & AI Platform**

**Title:** Breaking Silos, Accelerating Intelligence

**Main Points:**

* Our current data & ML workflows are fragmented:

  * Data lives in silos, slowing decision-making.
  * Manual handoffs between teams increase errors and delays.
  * Monitoring models and ensuring consistency is time-consuming.
* We need a scalable, integrated platform to power the next generation of analytics and AI.
* **Databricks enables this by unifying our data, analytics, and machine learning efforts.**

**Bottom line:** Faster decisions, better models, more automation—with fewer dependencies.

## 🟦 **Slide 2: What Is Databricks? The Lakehouse Advantage**

**Title:** One Platform for All Our Data and AI Needs

**Main Points:**

* Databricks is a **Lakehouse Platform**—combining the scalability of data lakes with the performance of data warehouses.
* Built on open standards (Spark, Delta Lake, MLflow).
* Supports all types of data: structured, unstructured, streaming, batch.
* One workspace for data engineers, scientists, and analysts to collaborate.

**How this helps us:**

* No more jumping between tools.
* Reduced operational complexity.
* Everyone works on the same version of data.

## 🟦 **Slide 3: How Databricks Changes Our Workflow**

**Title:** From Manual to Automated, From Friction to Flow

**Before Databricks:**

* Data engineers deliver extracts manually.
* Models rebuilt from scratch in siloed environments.
* Business waits days or weeks for updates or insights.

**With Databricks:**

* Real-time data ingestion and processing.
* Reusable data pipelines and features for ML.
* Automated monitoring and retraining of models.
* Instant collaboration through shared notebooks.

**Impact:**

* **Days of work become hours.**
* Fewer errors, faster model updates.
* Teams aligned and working from the same source of truth.

## 🟦 **Slide 4: What We Can Do with Databricks**

**Title:** Key Capabilities That Drive Value

| **Functionality**           | **What It Enables for Us**                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Delta Lake**              | Reliable, versioned, high-quality datasets                    |
| **Unified Notebooks**       | Collaboration between data, analytics, and ML teams           |
| **Feature Store**           | Reusable ML features for better model accuracy & speed        |
| **Model Registry & MLflow** | Transparent model tracking, testing, deployment, and rollback |
| **Streaming (Auto Loader)** | Near real-time use cases like fraud detection and alerting    |
| **Dashboards & Alerts**     | Visual, automated monitoring for business users               |

**Note:** These aren’t abstract tools—they directly reduce delays, improve reliability, and help us deliver impact faster.

## 🟦 **Slide 6 (Optional): What Success Looks Like in 90 Days**

**Title:** Rapid Value from Day One

**First 90 Days Goals:**

* ✅ Pilot use case in production (e.g., streaming fraud detection).
* ✅ Daily refresh of curated datasets with version control.
* ✅ Stakeholder dashboard live with alerts.
* ✅ Initial model lifecycle managed in the platform.
* ✅ Teams trained and collaborating in shared notebooks.

**Next Step:**

* Expand to additional teams and models, building a scalable ecosystem.
