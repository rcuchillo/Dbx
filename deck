Subject: Re: Model Refresh - Benefits

Hi Dan,

Thanks for sharing the plan, and apologies for the delay in getting back to you.

I’m glad to see that we’re exploring the option of recalibrating the model between retrains. Even if a fortnightly cadence might be difficult to sustain in the long run, it’s definitely a step in the right direction. That said, if we don’t run a backtest to validate the impact of each calibration, we’ll still need to confirm implementation accuracy—perhaps by releasing in shadow for a day or two before moving straight to production.

On the benefits side, I had a chat with Liam last week. My view is that we should frame the analysis around the cost of doing nothing. One approach would be to pick an example where a model remained in production for an extended period and showed clear signs of performance degradation. The expectation would be that a refresh brings performance back in line with target levels. We could then extrapolate what the performance would likely have looked like over the following 3 to 6 months had the model not been refreshed. The delta from this exercise gives us a tangible measure of the opportunity cost of inaction.

Happy to discuss further if helpful.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
