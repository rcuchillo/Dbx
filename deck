Perfect â€” then letâ€™s lock in a by function scheme. This approach helps you and your PA instantly see what kind of work is filling your time (strategic vs operational vs personal, etc.).

ðŸ“… Colour-Coding by Function

Function	Colour	Examples

Strategic / Leadership	Purple	Board meetings, strategy reviews, senior leadership offsites.
Operational / Delivery	Blue	Project updates, progress reviews, working groups.
Relationship Building	Green	Client meetings, networking, mentoring, external stakeholder sessions.
Focus / Deep Work	Yellow	Time blocked for analysis, drafting, preparation, or uninterrupted thinking.
Personal / Wellbeing	Teal	Exercise, breaks, family commitments.
Tentative / Flexible	Grey	Placeholders, optional events, anything that can move easily.

ðŸ›  Tips for You and Your PA

Keep to 5â€“6 colours only â€” any more creates noise.

Label categories in your calendar system (Outlook/Google) with names matching the scheme.

Protective use: Yellow (focus) and Teal (personal) should be treated as hard boundaries unless you explicitly release them.

Quick scans: At the end of each week, you can glance at your diary and see if your time balance looks healthy (e.g., too much blue = too operational, not enough purple = less strategic focus).

Do you want me to also design a visual one-page reference with the colour swatches so your PA has something they can stick to their screen/desk as a guide?
