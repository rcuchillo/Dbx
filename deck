Got it — you're looking for concise bullet-point rules that can be enforced (or at least communicated) to your team. Here's a clean and strict set you can customize and share:

🔒 Cluster Usage Rules

⚠️ Max Resource Usage: No single user may consume more than 25% of total cluster resources (CPU/memory) at any time, unless explicitly approved in advance.

🕐 Job Duration Limit: Any job running longer than 12 hours will be automatically terminated unless pre-approved.

💤 Idle Jobs: Jobs idle for more than 30 minutes will be terminated automatically.

🚫 High-Usage Job Termination: Jobs using more than 30% of total resources for over 1 hour without approval will be killed to ensure fairness.

📆 Advance Booking: Large jobs (e.g., >8 cores or >4 GPUs) must be booked in advance via the team scheduler or Slack channel.

🧾 Mandatory Tagging: All jobs must include tags: owner, team, and purpose. Untagged jobs may be terminated without warning.

🔄 Review Period: Cluster usage will be reviewed weekly. Repeat offenders may be temporarily blocked from launching new jobs.

Would you like this exported as a PDF/poster or posted automatically to a team Slack channel every Monday as a reminder? I can also help you enforce these rules programmatically (e.g., in Databricks or Kubernetes).
