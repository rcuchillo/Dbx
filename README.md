The interview went well overall, and he clearly has solid experience, especially in governance-heavy transformation environments. That said, there were some concerns about how closely that experience matches what this role needs.

He was credible on governance (including data governance) and could describe the expected controls and structures well. But a lot of his answers came back to governance as the main answer. For this role, the bigger need is someone who can work in a more delivery-focused, federated way — bringing teams together, dealing with competing priorities, and keeping things moving at pace.

A few gaps stood out:

Limited evidence of directly relevant change leadership
He spoke well at a general level, but didn’t really show enough hands-on experience leading a complex change programme where different teams with different priorities had to be aligned and mobilised quickly.

Backlog prioritisation felt more process-led than value-led
He focused mainly on t-shirt sizing and effort, but there was less emphasis on prioritising around business value, risk reduction, delivery impact, and strategic outcomes.

Not enough evidence of federating teams to deliver at pace
He didn’t give strong examples of bringing cross-functional teams together, working through conflicting priorities, and maintaining momentum in practice.

Confidence / executive presence
Although he has experience, he came across as less confident than expected for this role. In particular, there wasn’t much evidence of him confidently setting direction, challenging stakeholders, or driving decisions in ambiguous situations.

More focused on defining governance than using it to unblock delivery
He described what good governance looks like, but it was less clear how he would apply it in a practical, proportionate way to improve delivery and decision-making.

Limited depth on difficult stakeholder dynamics
His examples didn’t go far enough on how he handles disagreement, unclear ownership, or entrenched ways of working — which are all central to this role.
