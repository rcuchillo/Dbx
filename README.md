Ah — that’s an important shift.

So this is not:

> “What our AI strategy is”



It’s:

> “The principles that guide how I make strategic decisions.”



That’s much more senior — and much stronger.

In that case, the headline should reflect decision-making discipline, not delivery.

Stronger Strategy Headline Options (Decision-Oriented)

Option 1 (Recommended)

Principles Guiding Our Strategic Decisions in AI and Economic Crime Risk


---

Option 2 (Sharper & More Executive)

How We Make Strategic Decisions on AI in Group Control


---

Option 3 (More Formal)

Strategic Decision Framework for AI and Advanced Analytics


---

Option 4 (Very Clean)

Our Strategic Principles for AI and Economic Crime Risk


---

Option 5 (Board-Ready & Mature)

Decision Principles for Scaling AI Responsibly Across Group Control


---

If you want something more natural and less “framework-like”:

> The Principles That Guide Our AI Strategy

Now — since these are decision principles, they should sound like rules you follow when making trade-offs, not programme pillars.

Here is a refined set (5 principles), framed explicitly as decision lenses.


---

Strategic Decision Principles


---

1. Impact Before Innovation

Description

We prioritise initiatives that deliver measurable risk reduction or control improvement over technology-led experimentation.

Benefits

Clear value narrative

Stronger prioritisation discipline

Avoids fragmentation


Examples

Prioritising use cases with measurable fraud value impact

Delaying low-impact AI experimentation



---

2. Trust Is Non-Negotiable

Description

We only scale AI solutions that are explainable, governed, monitored and aligned to policy and regulatory expectations.

Benefits

Reduced regulatory risk

Faster stakeholder confidence

Sustainable adoption


Examples

No production release without monitoring

Clear audit trail and documentation



---

3. Industrialise Before We Scale

Description

We invest in MLOps and repeatable delivery foundations before expanding use cases.

Benefits

Faster future scaling

Reduced operational fragility

Lower long-term cost


Examples

Standardised pipelines

Versioned data and models

Automated deployment and monitoring



---

4. Build Enterprise Capability, Not Point Solutions

Description

We favour reusable platforms, shared standards and cross-team enablement over isolated solutions.

Benefits

Reduced duplication

Shared learning

Stronger enterprise coherence


Examples

Shared feature libraries

Training and documentation standards

Cross-Group Control support



---

5. Continuously Adapt to Emerging Risk

Description

We treat AI capability as a living system, evolving in response to typology shifts, data changes and regulatory expectations.

Benefits

Faster response to new threats

Reduced model degradation

Long-term resilience


Examples

Champion–challenger testing

Regular threshold recalibration

Periodic strategic reviews



---

Notice how these read like:

> “When faced with a trade-off, this is how we decide.”



That’s senior-level strategy.

If you'd like, I can now:

Make them even sharper (shorter, more punchy — 1 line each), or

Add a short executive narrative paragraph that introduces the principles on the slide.
